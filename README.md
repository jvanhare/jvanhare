# About
Since June 2020, I am a research engineer in the DMPE/PLM team
at [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/fr), [The French Aerospace Lab](https://www.onera.fr/en).
This team is composed of the main developpers of the [CEDRE](https://cedre.onera.fr/) suite.
  
My reasearch interests lie in numerical methods and tools for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
I am working on high-order and high-fidelity numerical methods and
high-order anisotropic mesh adaptation to perform Large Eddy Simulation around complex geometries.

## Research interests

* Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
* Steady and unsteady Navier-Stokes simulations on industrial configurations
* High-order and high-fidelity numerical methods
* (High-order) anisotropic unstructured mesh adaptation
* Finite Volume Method (FVM) and Finite Element Method (FEM)
* Reynolds-Averaged Navierâ€“Stokes (RANS) simulations
* Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
* High Performance Computing (HPC)
* Homogeneous and Heterogeneous System Architectures (HSA)
