# About
Since June 2020, I am a research engineer in the DMPE/PLM team
at [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/fr), [The French Aerospace Lab](https://www.onera.fr/en).
This team is composed of the main developpers of the [CEDRE](https://cedre.onera.fr/) suite.

My reasearch interests lie in numerical methods and tools for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
I am working on high-order and high-fidelity numerical methods and
high-order anisotropic mesh adaptation to perform Large Eddy Simulation around complex geometries.

## Research interests

* Reynolds-Averaged Navierâ€“Stokes (RANS) simulations
* Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
* High Performance Computing (HPC)

### Numerical schemes for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

* Finite Volume Method (FVM)
* Finite Element Method (FEM)
* Discontinuous Galerkin Method (DGM)
* Spectral Difference Method (SDM)
* Flux Reconstruction Method (FRM)
* Cell-centered and cell-vertex discretizations
* High-order and high-fidelity numerical methods

### Meshing technology

* Simplicial mesh generation
* Anisotropic unstructured mesh adaptation

### Applications fields

* Steady and unsteady Navier-Stokes simulations on industrial aeronautic configurations
* Fluid Structure Interactions (FSI)
* Blast for security and defense
* Sonic boom prediction
* Hypersonic flows
* Multi-species reacting flows
